Rope simulation! My goal was more stable and controllable ropes, and as a final goal even implementing a grappling hook. I didn't quite get there, and only settled with a collidable moving rope. It was mostly just [Verlet Integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZ8IGOHsjBk).

It works well and doens't have a big performance impact, but it is limited, it's client sided, and it won't handle many cases well.
