Been exploring Flutter lately, with the intent of using it to develop an app idea that I had for a while, this app idea involved blob shapes being around the screen!

Flutter's Canvas class made this easily doable (which is why I fell in love with it!). The idea behind this is drawing points around the circumference of a circle, then randomly using noise displacing them away and into the center by small periodic amounts, and connecting the dots with a spline, this forms the wanted effect!

```dart
for (int i = 0; i < N_POINTS; i++) {
    var noise = noiseObject.getNoise2(xoff, yoff);
    var radius = RADIUS.toDouble() + (20 * noise);

    if (initialRadius == 0) {
    initialRadius = radius;
    }

    points.add(center + Offset.fromDirection(2 * pi * i / N_POINTS, radius));

    xoff += 1;
    yoff += 2;
}
```

The idea behind forming a shape like this,

One issue is that there is dent there, due to the noise sequence not start and ending at the same elevation, my first solution was this! As we got closer to the last point, which meant `i/N_POINT` came closer to 1, (I'd use a function like `x^20` to make it so that only values really close to 1 are taken into consideration), I'd lerp it towards the first point's elevation, and it works!

```dart
for (int i = 0; i < N_POINTS; i++) {
    var noise = noiseObject.getNoise2(xoff, yoff);
    var radius = RADIUS.toDouble() + (20 * noise);

    if (initialRadius == 0) {
    initialRadius = radius;
    }

    points.add(center + Offset.fromDirection(2 * pi * i / N_POINTS, lerpDouble(radius, initialRadius, pow(i/N_POINTS, 20).toDouble()) ?? radius.toDouble()));

    xoff += 1;
    yoff += 2;
}
```
